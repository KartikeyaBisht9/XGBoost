# XGBoost
Applying XGBoost to option price prediction.

This is a practice project whereby I build a option-pricing model (using Extreme Gradient Boosting) and then use it to carry out live option price predictions & compare these predictions against the option prices quoted by the market. 

The Jupyter notebook titled "Core Model" details the building of my model.
The Jupyter notebook titles "Live predictions" can be executed to generate live predictions of option prices with my model preloaded and data being scraped from the internet.
